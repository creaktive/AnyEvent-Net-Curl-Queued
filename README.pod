=head1 DESCRIPTION

Efficient and flexible batch downloader with a straight-forward interface:

=over 4

=item *

create a queue;

=item *

append/prepend URLs;

=item *

wait for downloads to end (retry on errors).

=back

Download init/finish/error handling is defined through L<Moose's method modifiers|Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers>.

=head2 MOTIVATION

I am very unhappy with the performance of L<LWP>.
It's almost perfect for properly handling HTTP headers, cookies & stuff, but it comes at the cost of I<speed>.
While this doesn't matter when you make single downloads, batch downloading becomes a real pain.

When I download large batch of documents, I don't care about cookies or headers, only content and proper redirection matters.
And, as it is clearly an I/O bottleneck operation, I want to make as many parallel requests as possible.

So, this is what L<CPAN> offers to fulfill my needs:

=over 4

=item *

L<Net::Curl>: Perl interface to the all-mighty L<libcurl|http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>, is well-documented (opposite to L<WWW::Curl>);

=item *

L<AnyEvent>: the L<DBI> of event loops. L<Net::Curl> also provides a nice and well-documented example of L<AnyEvent> usage (L<03-multi-event.pl|Net::Curl::examples/Multi::Event>);

=item *

L<MooseX::NonMoose>: L<Net::Curl> uses a Pure-Perl object implementation, which is lightweight, but a bit messy for my L<Moose>-based projects. L<MooseX::NonMoose> patches this gap.

=back

L<AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued> is a glue module to wrap it all together.
It offers no callbacks and (almost) no default handlers.
It's up to you to extend the base class L<AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy> so it will actually download something and store it somewhere.

=head2 ALTERNATIVES

As there's more than one way to do it, I'll list the alternatives which can be used to implement batch downloads:

=over 4

=item *

L<WWW::Mechanize>: no (builtin) parallelism, no (builtin) queueing. Slow, but very powerful for site traversal;

=item *

L<LWP::UserAgent>: no parallelism, no queueing. L<WWW::Mechanize> is built on top of LWP, by the way;

=item *

L<LWP::Curl>: L<LWP::UserAgent>-alike interface for L<WWW::Curl>. No parallelism, no queueing. Fast and simple to use;

=item *

L<HTTP::Tiny>: no parallelism, no queueing. Fast and part of CORE since Perl v5.13.9;

=item *

L<HTTP::Lite>: no parallelism, no queueing. Also fast;

=item *

L<AnyEvent::Curl::Multi>: queued parallel downloads via L<WWW::Curl>. Queues are non-lazy, thus large ones can use many RAM;

=item *

L<Parallel::Downloader>: queued parallel downloads via L<AnyEvent::HTTP>. Very fast and is pure-Perl (compiling event driver is optional). You only access results when the whole batch is done; so huge batches will require lots of RAM to store contents.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 allow_dups

Allow duplicate requests (default: false).
By default, requests to the same URL (more precisely, requests with the same L<signature|AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy/sha> are issued only once.
To seed POST parameters, you must extend the L<AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy> class.
Setting C<allow_dups> to true value disables request checks.

=head2 completed

Count completed requests.

=head2 cv

L<AnyEvent> condition variable.
Initialized automatically, unless you specify your own.
Also reset automatically after L</wait>, so keep your own reference if you really need it!

=head2 max

Maximum number of parallel connections (default: 4; minimum value: 1).

=head2 multi

L<Net::Curl::Multi> instance.

=head2 queue

C<ArrayRef> to the queue.
Has the following helper methods:

=over 4

=item *

queue_push: append item at the end of the queue;

=item *

queue_unshift: prepend item at the top of the queue;

=item *

dequeue: shift item from the top of the queue;

=item *

count: number of items in queue.

=back

=head2 share

L<Net::Curl::Share> instance.

=head2 stats

L<AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Stats> instance.

=head2 timeout

Timeout (default: 60 seconds).

=head2 unique

Signature cache.

=head2 watchdog

The last resort against the non-deterministic chaos of evil lurking sockets.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 start()

Populate empty request slots with workers from the queue.

=head2 empty()

Check if there are active requests or requests in queue.

=head2 add($worker)

Activate a worker.

=head2 append($worker)

Put the worker (instance of L<AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy>) at the end of the queue.
For lazy initialization, wrap the worker in a C<sub { ... }>, the same way you do with the L<Moose> C<default =E<gt> sub { ... }>:

    $queue->append(sub {
        AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy->new({ initial_url => 'http://.../' })
    });

=head2 prepend($worker)

Put the worker (instance of L<AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy>) at the beginning of the queue.
For lazy initialization, wrap the worker in a C<sub { ... }>, the same way you do with the L<Moose> C<default =E<gt> sub { ... }>:

    $queue->prepend(sub {
        AnyEvent::Net::Curl::Queued::Easy->new({ initial_url => 'http://.../' })
    });

=head2 wait()

Process queue.

=for Pod::Coverage queue_push
queue_unshift
dequeue
count

=head1 CAVEAT

The I<"Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0xdeadbeef during global destruction."> message on finalization is mostly harmless.
